# Worktree

Give every milestone worker its own working tree. Three modes: **cut**, **provision**, and
**teardown**.

A milestone loop needs this before it can run. A fresh worktree holds no `.env`, no
`auth.json`, no `vendor/`, and no `node_modules/`. It also cannot start a container stack
without colliding with the stack already running. Every gate in the corpus fails on an
unprovisioned worktree for reasons unrelated to the change.

`rules/solo-agent-orchestration.md` carries the worktree standard. This skill implements that
standard and invents no second convention.

This skill refuses a repository that is not a container yet. `/bare-convert` sets one up, or
converts an existing clone, and it runs before the first cut.

## The layout

The container is the repository's own path, at whatever depth it sits.

```
<container>/                       the repository's own path
  .git/                            bare repository
  main/                            the user's stable worktree, never removed
  <plan-slug>-<milestone-slug>/    a milestone worktree
  <plan-slug>-<milestone-slug>/    a second milestone worktree
```

Every milestone worktree carries the plan slug as a prefix. The plan slug leads with a sortable
timestamp, so one plan's worktrees sort together and two plans never interleave. The stable
worktree keeps the name `main`, and it carries no prefix.

The branch carries the plan slug too: `<type>/<plan-slug>-<milestone-slug>`. Teardown keeps the
branch, and `/implement`'s close step deletes the KV that names it. The prefix is therefore what
tells a resume from another plan's leftover. `rules/solo-agent-orchestration.md` states that
reasoning once.

Every slug is lowercase, because a KV key carries it.

## Derive the container from any worktree

Every mode needs the container path, and this skill states the one derivation. Read it from any
worktree of that repository:

```bash
CONTAINER="$(dirname "$(git -C "<any-worktree>" \
  rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
```

Two wrong derivations look right. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns the worktree, so
`<container>/main` reaches a caller that wanted `<container>`. Cut mode then tests
`<container>/main/.git` for bareness, reads `false`, and refuses a converted container. Verified
on git 2.50.1.

`--path-format=absolute` is load-bearing. Without it `--git-common-dir` may answer the relative
`.git`, and `dirname` then returns `.`. Verified on git 2.50.1.

`/plan` records the container with this derivation, so the path it hands `/implement` needs no
repair.

## What the caller passes

Every mode takes the container, the milestone slug, and the branch. Cut alone takes the base,
because only cut creates anything.

```
<container>        the repository's own path
<milestone-slug>   the milestone slug, lowercase — the `[milestone]` argument
<branch>           <type>/<plan-slug>-<milestone-slug>, resolved by the caller
<base>             origin/HEAD, or the predecessor milestone's branch when the milestones stack
```

**Never rebuild the branch name here.** `<type>` is `feat`, `fix`, or `chore`, chosen for the work
per `rules/pr-first-contributions.md`. Only the caller holds that choice. Build the name here as
well, and the two constructions can differ. The next pass then reads a KV key naming a branch that
does not exist. It takes the collision case, and escalates over its own branch.

Three more values follow from those four, and this skill states each derivation once:

```
<worktree>    <container>/ then <branch> with its <type>/ prefix removed
<plan-slug>   <branch> with its <type>/ prefix and its -<milestone-slug> suffix removed
<repo>        the basename of <container>
```

`/implement` resolves all four before it calls, and it passes them in the order above.

## Cut

Use this mode to create a milestone worktree and provision it.

Refuse a plain clone. Test the container itself, never `<container>/main`:

```bash
if ! git --git-dir="<container>/.git" rev-parse --is-bare-repository 2>/dev/null \
     | grep -qx true; then
  echo "error: <container> holds no bare repository" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Report that refusal to the user:

**Blocked — `<container>` is not a container**

```
found:      <container>/.git is a plain clone, not a bare repository
needed:     the bare-plus-worktrees layout, per rules/solo-agent-orchestration.md
next:       /bare-convert convert <container>
```

⏸ waiting on you: run /bare-convert convert <container>, or name another container

Test the branch and the recorded worktree path before you cut. `rules/solo-agent-orchestration.md`
carries both tests, the three branch cases, and the escalation each one demands. Follow it rather
than a second copy here.

Then cut the worktree:

```bash
git -C "<container>/main" worktree add "<worktree>" -b "<branch>" "<base>"
```

Pass no `-b` on a resume, because the branch already exists. Where the recorded path already holds
this milestone's branch, reuse that worktree and cut nothing.

Record the path under `plan:<slug>:milestone:<m>:worktree:<repo>`, as the orchestration rule
requires. Then run provision mode against the new worktree.

**Provision mode can refuse, and cut then ends `Blocked` with the worktree standing.** Report that
refusal as provision mode writes it. The recorded path stays correct, so the retry reuses the tree
rather than cutting a second one.

## Provision

Use this mode to fill a worktree that already exists. Cut mode runs it, and you can run it again
after a lockfile changes.

**Refuse a worktree that carries no provisioning script.** Test it first, because the command
below runs the script directly:

```bash
test -x "<worktree>/scripts/wt-provision.sh"
```

Report that refusal to the user:

**Blocked — `<repo>` carries no provisioning script**

```
found:      <worktree>/scripts/wt-provision.sh is missing, or it is not executable
needed:     the script this repository commits, per ## The provisioning contract below
next:       /bare-convert script <container>
kept:       <worktree>, so the script can land on this milestone's branch
```

⏸ waiting on you: run /bare-convert script <container>, or commit the script yourself

**Keep the worktree and the branch here.** The cleanup below undoes a script that ran and failed.
A script that never existed leaves nothing to undo. Remove the tree, and the retry meets the same
absence, so the run loops instead of reporting.

**A milestone worktree is a checkout, so `HEAD` must carry the script.** A script left untracked
in `<container>/main` reaches no worktree cut afterwards. `/bare-convert` states that too.

```bash
"<worktree>/scripts/wt-provision.sh" "<container>/main" "<worktree>"
```

**Run the script from the target worktree, not from `main`.** Pass `main` as the source argument
only, which is the whole of its role. A milestone whose own branch updates the script must run
the updated one. A stacked milestone inherits its predecessor's version the same way.

**Clean up after a failed provision.** The worktree and the branch both exist by then, so the
retry fails on two paths that are already taken:

```bash
git -C "<container>/main" worktree remove --force "<worktree>"
git --git-dir="<container>/.git" branch -D "<branch>"
```

Delete the branch only when this cut created it. A resume cut onto an existing branch, and that
branch carries work the remote holds.

## The provisioning contract

Each target repository commits its own script at `scripts/wt-provision.sh`. It takes the source
worktree and the target worktree as arguments:

```bash
scripts/wt-provision.sh <source-worktree> <target-worktree>
```

The script owns three responsibilities.

### Files

**Copy the machine-local files.** `.env`, `auth.json`, and certificates are untracked, so a
fresh worktree holds none of them.

**Clone the derived state, then reconcile it.** The reconcile re-runs the install. It is
mandatory rather than optional. A cloned `.terraform/` or `vendor/` can carry absolute paths
that point back at the source worktree. A cloned `node_modules/` matches whatever lockfile the
source held.

A clone alone is therefore unsafe. The clone gives you the speed, and the reconcile gives you
the correctness.

### Containers

**Publish no host ports.** Generate an override that resets the port list of **every** service
the base file declares. Read that service list rather than a fixed pair:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config --services
```

Emit one `ports: !reset []` entry per service into `docker-compose.worktree.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  <each service the command above printed>:
    ports: !reset []
```

`ports: !reset []` removes every published port on Compose v5.1.2, verified. Compose discards
the base port list rather than merging it.

An override that names a subset leaves the rest publishing. The second milestone stack then
fails to bind, and the gate fails for a reason unrelated to the change. Check the generated
override before you start anything:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.worktree.yml config \
  | grep -c published
```

That count must be 0. Some repositories bind ports that no offset can move, and a shifted
published port breaks every URL the app generates. Removal is therefore the only safe answer.

**Run the gates inside the compose network.**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.worktree.yml run --rm app <gate>
```

The compose network sits closer to production than a host-published port, which is what
`rules/testing-philosophy.md` asks for.

**Name the project explicitly.** Export
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<repo>-<plan-slug>-<milestone-slug>`. Compose otherwise derives the
project name from the directory basename, verified.

The plan slug matters here, exactly as it does in the worktree path. Two live plans can
name a milestone `m1`, and `<repo>-m1` then gives both stacks one network and one volume set.
The worktree paths would stay distinct while the stacks merged.

### Each milestone stack is fully isolated

Its own containers, its own volumes, its own network, and no published ports.
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` gives one milestone one Compose project, and a project creates a container
for every service its base file declares.

Isolation therefore needs no naming convention inside the stack. Two milestones can hold a
bucket, a topic, or a database of the same name. Neither project can see the other's.

The milestone owns those volumes, which is why teardown removes them.

## The clone helper

Every provisioning script calls one shared helper, so many repositories do not grow many
dialects:

```bash
~/.claude/bin/wt-clone.sh "<source>" "<destination>"
```

It clones copy-on-write where the filesystem supports one, and it copies plainly everywhere
else. It reports the mode it chose, and it exits non-zero when the copy fails.

**It refuses a source holding a symlink that resolves outside the source root.** A pnpm-style
store keeps its internal links and clones fine. A `vendor/` directory holding a path repository
does not, and the helper names the link it refused. Run the reconcile alone for that source.

The helper checks the filesystem before it copies. `cp -c` on macOS falls back to a plain copy
without reporting it, and `cp --reflink=auto` does the same on Linux. A caller that expected a
clone would otherwise consume the full size of the source with no warning.

A clone costs time by file count rather than by bytes, and it consumes no space until the copy
diverges.

## Teardown

Tear the stack down at milestone close. Remove the worktree after the push succeeds.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="<repo>-<plan-slug>-<milestone-slug>" docker compose \
  --project-directory "<worktree>" \
  -f "<worktree>/docker-compose.yml" \
  -f "<worktree>/docker-compose.worktree.yml" down -v --remove-orphans
```

**Every path here is absolute, and that is load-bearing.** Teardown's callers reach this block
from somewhere else, and none of them sets a working directory. A relative `-f` then finds no
file, or it finds another repository's stack.

`down -v` removes the named volumes, and `--remove-orphans` removes a container that the
current file no longer declares. The milestone owns both, so neither removal reaches another
stack.

**Check that the tree holds nothing to lose, then force the removal.**

```bash
git -C "<worktree>" rev-list --count '@{upstream}..HEAD'
git -C "<worktree>" status --porcelain
```

The first must return 0, which proves the push carried every commit. The second must list only
paths the provisioning contract wrote. Stop and report any other line.

```bash
git -C "<container>/main" worktree remove --force "<worktree>"
```

**`--force` is mandatory here, not a fallback.** Plain `git worktree remove` refuses a tree
holding a modified tracked file, or an untracked file the repository does not ignore. The
generated `docker-compose.worktree.yml` is exactly such a file, so the plain form exits 128 on
the first provisioned repository. Verified on git 2.50.1.

`--force` removes the tree and the `worktree list` entry together, so teardown needs no prune.
The rule sweeps with `git worktree prune` at run close. The branch survives the removal, and it
lives on the remote once the push succeeds, so the worktree is disposable.
